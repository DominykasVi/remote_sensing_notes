presentation  - april 7/8 essay (no report, topic presentation)
project - may 26/27 (practical)

# Fundamentals of Remote Sensing
Remote sensing - collection of radiation, with sensor, withour touching

captures colors in rgb

Draw this schema ==next class== #nextClass

Actives satelites - can emit radiation (radar radiation), can operate during the night, not affected by atmosphere
Passive satelites - only capture

Optic remote sensing -  rgb, infrared
Calculate ecological footprint/what it is

Radar Presentation- how it works, the basics, ==ask after class==, #urgent

Radiation - particles of energy moving in wawes, main difference the frequency/wawelength (distance between of the peaks)

Speed oflight is constant

Know how to draw electro magnetic spectrum #important

from 0.4 to 0.7 micrometers #later

blue - 0.4 to 0.5
green - 0.5 to 0.6
red. - 0.6 to 0.7

Know ==slide 21==
What happens?
what is scatering?
Types of scatering?

 What can happpento to radieatio in the atmosphere:
 - scatering
 - absorbtion

what is rayleigh scattering?

why is sunset red? BECAUSE OF THE DISTANCE, more red comes and makes it scatterred
nonselective scatering happens in water, because of this clouds are white
Why are clouds white?

Transmition = Transparency

What radiation we use in remote sensing? Microwave, Visible, some part of infrared
what is atmospheric window?
what heppens to radiation when it reaches the earth?
what is reflectance? p/proportion of the incident energy that is reflected, affected only by the objects

## Presentation for friday!
Spectral signatures, know. how to draw! (below)

what is the color composite? first question to ask when looking at the image
