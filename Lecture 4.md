The four resolutions
RADAR radiation, expand on the police example

types of orbits:
polar orbit - 1000 km, geostationary orbit - 35 800 km (~36 000)

satekute working principles:
- along track scanning
- cross-tracking scanner

1972 - first satelite (USA) Landsat MASS XC (80 m)

very high spatial resolution (4
4 - 100 high spatial resolution
100 - 300 mediumm s r
">" 300 low spatial resolution

Quickbirth, IKONOS - first with high spatial resolution 4m/2m (multispectral/panformaic google)
GEOeye, worldview - current very good

ISA - european space angency
Galileo - european GPS

ikonos, quickbirht, sentinel 2, modis, meris, sentinel 3, spot vegetation, nova/avhrr
a lot more, look at notes, all in notes
tmr: draw one of the three graphs: remote sensing system, e.r spectrum, spectral signatures


### Very high (1-4 bands):
1. GeoEye - 30 cm, replaacing IKONOS
2. Wordlview - 50 cm. pencromatic,  2 m. spectral
3. IKONOS - dead, continuation is geoeye, p - 2m., mp - 4m.
4. Quickbirth - dead, replaced by worldview
### High spatial resolution (Have more MIR bands, 4-100)
5. LANDSAT (first) 30m, USA, 72
6. SPOT - France, 20 m. first european, new 10 m., (at first launch no MIR bands)
7. SENTINEL 2 (coopernicus) - 10m, european
### Medium/moderet resolution (1-4, thermal):
8. MODIS mounted on Terra/AQUA, USA - 250-300 m.
9. MERIS -  envisat satelite - not operating/european, 250-300 m.
10. sentinel 3 - 300 m, european
 ### Low resolution (1-4, thermal):
11. Spot 3/4 , Vegetation- 1km, France
12. NOVA/AVHRR - 500/1000 m. meteorogical, in polar orbit

Gelileo - postioning system
russian gps?
chinese gps?

the 4 resolutions:
- !spatial - size of the pixel, loew resolution is usually free, sometimes we do not need high resolution t, because we might want to cover large area, takes up less space
- !spectral
- radiometric
- !temporal
