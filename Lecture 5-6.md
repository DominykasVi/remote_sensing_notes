## Spectral resolution
number of bands and the width of the bands
Pencromatic band - black and white, brg, a lot at the same time

Done so that we could collect more energy/can reduce the size oft the pixel

when bads are combined the size can be reduced from 4 m to 1 m. (size of pixel)

multispectral bands - are in larger pixels

panchromatic - 1 bands
multispectral - 1-10 bands
superspectral - 10-100 bands
hyperspectral - > 100 bands

## Radiometric resolution
Ability to store information- shades of gray stored in 2 bits (4 colors), 8 bits (256 values)

## Temporal resolution
time between two images

GEOSAT - portuguese satelites


Network of satelites can be. used to improve temporal resolution of an area
Rapid eye contelation - 5 satelites

PAN - panchromatix
XS -  multispectral (maybe)
swir - short wave infra red
Know geoEye-1/wordlview - 3

exam wil be sentences - true/or false sentence
 India - has best earth observation

 emergency services - need good spatial and temporal resolution![[Pasted image 20220225100358.png]]
