### What is remote sensing?
It collects radiantion with sensors from the earth, without touching it.
Remote sensing is the science of acquiring information about the Earth's surface without actually being in contact with it. This is done by sensing and recording reflected or emitted energy and processing, analyzing, and applying that information
### Components of remote sensing?

### What is the difference between active and passive satelites?
Active satelites can emit radiation (radar radiation), which can be used to observe the earth, it means that they can work during the night, while passive satelites cannot, because they only capture the reflected light
### What is radiation?
It is particles of energy moving in wawes, main difference the frequency/wawelength (distance between of the peaks
### How is wavelengt and frequency related?
They are inversely related
- the shorter the wavelength, the higher the frequency;  
• the longer the wavelength, the lower the frequency.
### Draw the electromagnetic spectrum
![[Pasted image 20220218085332.png]]
from -6 to 9,
Rays:
- cosmic (-7), 
- gamma rays -6
- X-ray -4
- UV -1
- visible light (0.4 - 0.7)
	- blue - 0.4 to 0.5
	- green - 0.5 to 0.6
	- red - 0.6 to 0.7
- near IR (0.8)
- Mid IR 1(c)
- Thermal IR 10(c)
- microwave (radar) 5
- radio and television 7-8
### What happens to particles entering the atmosphere:
- scattering
- absorbtion
### What is scattering?
Scattering occurs when particles or large gas molecules present in the atmosphere interact with and cause the electromagnetic radiation to be  
redirected from its original path.
Particles scatter electromacnetic radiation
### Types of scattering?
1. Rayleigh scattering,particles << wavelength, caused by particles such as small specks of dust or nitrogen and oxygen molecules.
2. Mie scattering, particles = wavelength, caused by dust, pollen, smoke and water vapour
3.  Nonselective scattering, particles >> wavelength, Nonselective scattering is caused by water droplets and large dust particles
### What is absorbtion?
causes molecules in the atmosphere to absorb  
energy at various wavelengths. Atmospheric absorption is mainly caused by ozone, carbon dioxide, and water vapour
### What radiation we use in remote sensing? 
Microwave, Visible, some part of infrared
### what is the atmospheric window?
Areas of the electromagnetic spectrum relatively free of absorption and scattering  
### what is reflectance? 
p/proportion of the incident energy that is reflected, affected only by the objects

### Draw spectral signatures:

### What are the three stages of image analysis?
- image visualization, 
- contrast enhancment, 
- statistical indicators
### Types of image visualization
 - one band visualiztion
- three band visualazition - color composites
### What are color composites?
You attach data from one sensor to one rgb color, true color composit is RGB 321, when red is mapped to red and so on, all other color composites such as RGB 421 are false color composites, because 4 (NIR is assigned to red)
### Color numbering from satelite
1. Blue
2. Green
3. Red
4. NIR
5. MIR
### Usual image visualization rules:
 - bands should not be correlated, because correlated bands do not provide new data
 - most used  asiggment of NIR(near infra red) is to red, 
 - water always shows as black, no matter composite, 
 - vegetation has NIR color, 
 - soil and urban have bright colors(not red))
