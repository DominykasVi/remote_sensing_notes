# Information extraction from satelite images?
## Image classification
Land cover/land use mapping (thematic map)
data into information

areas(simplified) (categorical variable):
- rock
- urban
- water
- agriculture
- forest


thematic remote sensing - thematic maps, map where we have categorical classes, use classification algorithms
quantitative map- map of biomass, use statistical models, continiuos variables

twp types of data models/maps:
- roster, map divided into pixels, by category
- vector, map where we draw lines to identify areas with specific land cover, use polygons

fuzzy map - brings fuzzyines of world into a map (very close to a clssification, areas around the threshold)

minimum mapping unit - samllest unit in a map (spatial) (in roster is pixel size, in vector dynamic)
use generalisation tools, when convertng roster to vector maps, because roster maps can be very noisy

object oriented image classification - classify poligons created from image segmentation

first question to ask when making a map? what map i want to create

data model?
how many categories?
minimal unit?

vineyards change
