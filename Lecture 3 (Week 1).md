# Exploratory image analysis
what are three stages? image visualization, ontrast enhancment, tatistical indicators

Image visualization:
- one band visualiztion
- three band visualazition - color composites

Code rgb explainer? as a simple app?

learno colors/numbers portuguesse?
True color composites: RGB 321
what are the numbers or radiation?
Colors LANDSAT:
1. Blue
2. Green
3. Red
4. NIR
5. MIR
6. Thermal
7. MIR 
False color composites - all others

## how do you create color composite? 
- bands should not be correlated, 
- most used NIR(near infra red) to red, 
- water always black, no matter composite,
- vegetation has NIR color,
- soil and urban have bright colors(not red))
