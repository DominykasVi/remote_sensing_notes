## How to interpret image, what to look for
- spectral patterns (color patterns)
- spatial patterns (arragement)
- tempral patterns (over time)

## Characteristics of images
- Image tone
- Shape
- Size
- Patterns
- Texture
- Shadow (can be used to measure height)
- Association

portugal tree classes:
 - conifrus (pine)
 - sifrus (broadleaf)

##  Image Preprocessing
processing - classification (max-imum light, decision trees, random forest)

multi-temporal remote sensing- use all images that are available


What are distortions? radipometric/ other

### geometric distortions
- systematic - predictable
- unsystematic - not predictable, corrected using epirical methods

### radiometric distortions
caused by what? atmosphere, sensor, geometry of illumination (expand all)

work with reflected radiation

coppernicus uses atmospheric band (sentinel), to collect information about. atmosphere and reduce the effect of atmosphere distortion

strategies for reducing distortions (might be radiometric):
- 

topographic effect? if something receives less sunlight, it looks darker, even though it might be the same

should have images at the same time of the year, so that vegetation would be reflected the same

can know how much resources are needed for crops
