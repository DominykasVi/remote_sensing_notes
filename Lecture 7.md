# Visual interpretation of satelite images

Know the graphic for vegetation/water/soil [[Remote Sensing/Lecture 2#Spectral signatures|Spectral signatures]]

How does RGB mapping work? How are resulting colors made?

When looking at a image:
1. What satelite am I seeing
2. What are color composites
3. Where is NIR band? It shows where vegetation is
[[Lecture 3 (Week 1)#how do you create color composite|Extra]]

### Image analysis
Agriculture - most bright
Forests - darker than agriculture

## Contrast enhancement
why do we need to enhance contrast? The range betwem color maximums might be very low (20 to 60), so we enhance contrast to see better
what are the techniques to enhance contrast?
#nextWeek canadian book, read the tutorial, might read about methods


Look at spectral - color and spatial- arrangement patterns when looking at images

Spatial patterns can help recognize urban areas from other ereas ( no vegetation)
Temporal profiles for noticing change

How is remote sensing important for a resume/professional life?
